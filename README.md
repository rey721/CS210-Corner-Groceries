# CS210-Corner-Groceries
•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
o	The subject was to create a n inventory tracker for the product on shelves.
•	What did you do particularly well?
o	I was able to create a C++ code that will demonstrate the data requested and the tracking needed
•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
o	I believe my issue came to be on the Phyton side were i did not got it to communicate property with the CC++ side
•	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
o	The coding in general is what I find challenging since I have difficulties retaining but as I create and see a code work successfully, I tag and save for future reference
•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
o	The concept of the project itself to be able to track inventory is one that I can see my self using again, in special at work.
•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
o	I use different system that will assist correct the programs including Visual Studio itself.
This help me see what area I was not being clear, or making since.
